How to run my webpage:
 1. Open 'https://github.com/dnabulsi/RSS-Parser'.
 2. Select the green button 'Code', then 'Download ZIP'.
 3. Extract the .zip file wherever you see fit on your computer.
 4. Open the file you've just extracted through VS Code, by selecting 'File' -> 'Open Workspace from File...'.
 5. Open a new terminal in VS Code, by selecting 'Terminal' -> 'New Terminal'.
 6. Move to your file's directory via the terminal, using `ls` to check where you are, then `cd` to move to the directory you want. 
    When you enter `ls` and see the files '__pycache__', 'app.py', 'HelpME.txt', 'requirements.txt', and 'templates', you are in the correct directory.
 7. Make sure to download Flask and feedparser per 'requirements.txt', by entering `pip install Flask` and `pip install feedparser` in the terminal window.
 8. Enter `flask run` in the terminal window.
 9. Open the URL link (most probably looks like 'http://127.0.0.1:5000') to view the locally hosted web page!
10. When you are finished, use CTRL + C in the terminal window to end the web page program.

If the number of lines is too big and the webpage is taking too long to load, go to 'app.py' and edit line 22 to `for entry in parserResponse.entries[:X]:`
where X is the amount of lines you want to be visible on the page. Thank you! :)
